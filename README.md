#Task1 - Factorial of a num
Get an input from the user
Start defining a function named factorial 
Within arguments define the input value to be entered by user
in statement type an condition with if else loop
since the factorial of 0 and 1 are 1 , give condition as if n<2 , return 1
if the n is not less than 2 , it skips if condition and jumps to else block
in else block type statement return n*factorial(n-1)
so the number multiplies with the factorial of its before digit
call the function
print the statement the factorial of 'the input given the user' is the factorial(n)


#Task2 - Math Module for calculations
Get a number as a input from the user 
start using import math module from * , to import all the functions in math module
Then use the sqrt function of the number 
use log function with number and base 
use sine function of the number to get sine value of it
